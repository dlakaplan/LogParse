# LogParse 
An evolving package meant to parse GBT/AO observing logs for email summaries (via cron jobs) and for data quality checks (quicklook).
Currently only includes capabilities to parse CIMA logs (AO).

### Dependencies

None; keeping this very lightweight at the moment for easy integration at AO.
