# IMPORTANT!  Edit this to pick which session you're observing
# All sources in the catalog will be observed in order, with the 
# remaining session time divided evenly between them. To 
# restart a interrupted session, first edit the catalog and comment
# out sources that have already been observed today.

# IMPORTANT!  Edit here to set the session's start/stop times in UTC!
# NOTES:
#  - start time does not need to be edited if the script is stopped/restarted.
#    it will always use the current time when running 'for real'.
#  - don't use any leading 0's in the values here, (leading 0 is code for
